   abstract = {Hemianopia is a visual impairment that significantly impacts patients' daily activities and limits their overall awareness by blocking half of their visual field. This project developed a VR headset-based application to remap the field of view of hemianopia patients by re-scaling and re-positioning feeds displayed from cameras on the front of the headset. The remapping technique employed was slightly different to other industry implementations and has the potential to be effective but needs further testing and refinement. The user study (N=8) tested the application against different scales of the camera feed remapping while performing a Fitts test, and users wore glasses to simulate hemianopia. The results showed that decreasing the remapping scale resulted in decreased accuracy and speed during the test. NASA-TLX results showed the overall task-load decreased from 100%-50% scale, and then increased again at 25%, which was consistently considered too small a scale to effectively view the world. Participants reported being most aware at 50% scale, and on average selected 63% scale when asked to manually select what was most comfortable and gave the most awareness to them. This possibly suggests a tentative range of optimal scales for awareness while using the remapping application. The application also induced some motion sickness symptoms, primarily at 100% and 75% scales, when compared against the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Finally, a parallel standalone study was conducted with a single hemianopia patient, which yielded similar performance and task-load results, but considerably more severe symptoms of motion sickness as the scale decreased from 100%-25% which was possibly exacerbated by post-stroke symptoms. The participant noted that using the remapping application stimulated their neural pathways and their right hand (which is usually obscured by their right homonymous hemianopia), potentially closing the visual feedback loop and suggesting there may be potential for neural pathway recovery for stroke and hemianopia patients using Virtual Reality visual remapping. i},

   abstract = {Stroke is the most common cause of homonymous hemianopia (HH) in adults, followed by trauma and tumors. Associated signs and symptoms, as well as visual field characteristics such as location and congruity, can help determine the location of the causative brain lesion. HH can have a significant effect on quality of life, including problems with driving, reading, or navigation. This can result in decreased independence, inability to enjoy leisure activities, and injuries. Understanding these restrictions, as well as the management options, can aid in making the best use of remaining vision. Treatment options include prismatic correction to expand the remaining visual field, compensatory training to improve visual search abilities, and vision restoration therapy to improve the vision itself. Spontaneous recovery can occur within the first months. However, because spontaneous recovery does not always occur, methods of reducing visual disability play an important role in the rehabilitation of patients with HH.},
